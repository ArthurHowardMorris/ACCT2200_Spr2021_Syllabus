# The choice between step, step-variable, and variable costs

- Requires a definition of a 'unit'
  - a pair of shoes
  - an hour of labor
  - a dollar of revenue
- There is always some unit that makes everything step or fixed
  - When a table is in multiples of 10 you can treat a batch of 10 as the base unit.
  - Step-variable are hard to identify from data, but are usually bundled goods.


# Does use of "fixed", "variable", or "step" vary by industry

- Yes.
- ... but this is __not__ an accounting system choice
- This is determined by the production process
  - A highly automated factory has high fixed-costs, because costs do not vary with units produced.
  - An industry where raw materials are expensive has high variable costs, because costs vary with each unit produced.
- Cost behavior determines whether we treat the cost as fixed or variable.
- Managers can choose how to design their production process, but they do not choose whether a cost is fixed or variable.

# Internal information systems:

- There are at least three key accounting systems:
  - Tax Accounting
  - Financial Accounting (for public companies)
  - Managerial Accounting
    - The MA system will be the most detailed (ABC requires much more information than GAAP)
- All three use cost and revenue data, and should share information.
- The terms "bookkeeper" and "accountant" are often used interchangeably.
  - There are some differences.
- If you have a CPA, or CMA certification then you are an accountant.
- Most small/medium firms use accounting software like QuickBooks.
  - A bookkeeper will be responsible for making sure that all costs and revenues are entered into the system correctly.
  - An accountant will oversee preparation of reports from the information in the system.
  - Bookkeepers are more common at small to medium firms.
  - Large firms will have a custom-made system "Enterprise Software"

# "Is there a situation where the high-low method is preferable?"

- If you are shipwrecked on a desert island.
- After the apocalypse.

#  When do absorption costing and variable costing differ?

- When there is a change in ending inventory.
- Absorption costing is _required_ for financial accounting.
  - We treat inventory as an asset.
    - Essential to estimating the __value__ of the firm.
    - GAAP is focused on valuation.
  - Creates an incentive to overproduce.
    - This only works in the short term.
    - Auditors and short sellers are always looking for evidence of this.
- Absorption costing ignores the fact that we have to pay for fixed costs when the bills are due not when we sell our products.
- Variable costing is much more useful for internal decisions, especially so that we know when to get external financing.

# Depreciation:

- Variable costing does not use depreciation.
  - We expense FC in the period we pay for them.
  - If we finance FC with a loan then we expense each loan _payment_
- In absorption costing, depreciation is a fixed cost and a period cost.
  - We use depreciation to assign the FC to a period's MOH account.
  - Within the period we assign using a cost driver.
  - Note that treating depreciation as a variable cost will lead to incorrect information.
  - Depreciation is __NOT REAL__
