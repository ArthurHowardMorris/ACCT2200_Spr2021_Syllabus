# Do we always prefer products with higher profit margin?

- Yes
- ... but it's never that simple:
- Food \& Beverage pricing
  - Coffee vs Pastries
  - Alcohol vs Food
- Promotions
- The market may not support more of the high margin product
  - Scarcity may be part of the appeal
- Limits on production
  - i.e. Rolex

# Activity rate and activity proportion are equivalent

- Use the one that's easier/more useful in your situation

# When to use ABC vs. VBC

- When overheads are high relative to total costs
- When there are:
  - multiple products
  - multiple processes consumed differentially by the products  
  - AND/OR various departments participate in more than one process
- Test!

# How do we pick cost drivers

1. Pick activity pools
2. Use those to motivate the driver
3. Driver should cause the cost
