# Chapter 8 Questions

<!-- some of these are new since last time -->

# What is a 'conservative' budget

- An aggressive budget might set very low cost standards and high sales standards
  - Often thought to be motivational
  - Can lead to bad outcomes, insufficient inventories, low quality inputs and outputs, employee turnover, unhappy customers, product recalls.
- A conservative budget may set high inventory standards, higher cost standards and lower sales standards
  - Inventory is costly and risky (may never sell).
  - Lower profits.
- The best strategy is to start conservative and increase efficiency over time (lower inventory and cost while maintaining quality)
  - Also maintain plans for "Black Swans"
  - We want to arive at a set of standards that are as close to reality as possible.
  - This includes building in safety and continuous improvement (sales, profit, costs, quality)

# Do all firms budget?

- Yes.
- Some less formally

# What order do we budget in?

- Sales
- Production
- Direct Materials
- Direct labor
- Overheads
- Summarize to total manufacturing costs
- SG&A
- Then the financial budgets (cash and financing)

# What about unexpected expenses?

- These are variances, and
- this is why we have things like cash reserves and lines of credit.

# Chapter 9 Questions

- Worth reviewing the algebra of variances and the price/quantity graph I shared.

# What is the difference between the master and flexible budgets?

- The sales forecast.
- We set up the master budget based on our sales forecast
- The flexible budget is simply the set of budgets that arise when we plug in any arbitrary numbers for sales.
- We use the flexible budget for calculating variances by plugging the actual sales into the flexible budget.

# Why not use actual costing?

- Because time travel is hard.
- Actual costing doesn't allow us to plan for the future, only record the past.

# Does fixed overhead variance matter?

- Unused capacity is costly, but gives us flexibility.
- Checking this variance allows us to understand how unused capacity is impacting our profitability.
- Should inform mid- and long-term decisions.

# What is transfer pricing for?

- When decision making is decentralized we need to track the flow and creation of value throughout the company
- We use transfer pricing to record the transfer of value between divisions of a company
  - Allows us to understand what happens when the retail store sells at a discount (doesn't change the value of the product, just the retail margin)

# ROI vs. Residual Income

- These measure fundamentally different things.
- ROI measures how quickly a particular project generates income.
- Residual income compares income to the hurdle rate.
